The Be Book / Haiku Book Amalgamation

This contains the work of creating the Be Book documentation in reStructuredText
format with Sphinx, and merging the Haiku Book documentation into the Be Book.

It is hoped that this will result in much more complete API documentation, and
is made possible by ACCESS Co. Ltd. who generously relicensed the documentation
so that derivative works can be created (this hopefully new Haiku Book).
